   the proposed filename ended with a trailing

   (as filenames cannot end with a trailing

   its name contained a period, everything
   before the period would be selected (as for

   (via a URL) would previously not be opened

   would not be shown correctly. Fixed.
 - When a file size was between 1000 and 1024 of the
   specified unit (bytes, KB, MB, etc), the fourth
   character would not be shown, causing the size to
   appear to be incorrect. Fixed.
 - Fixed a paste file bug.
 - If a file that could not be cut (such as a virtual
   item) was cut anyway using Ctrl+X, the item would
   be ghosted whether or not it was actually placed
   on the clipboard. Fixed.
 - The address bar would not scroll horizontally.
   Fixed.
 - Fixed tab highlight bug.

   item.
 - Items on the 'Go' menu now have their names
   taken directly from the operating system. This
   means, for example, that the 'My Computer' item
   will be shown as 'My Computer' on XP, but
   'Computer' on Vista.
 - Added an error message for the situation when a
   new folder could not be created.
 - A slight change to the bookmarks key means that
   bookmarks saved in previous versions will not
   have their paths loaded in this version

----------------------------
New features:

    2. the registry
   If neither of these options are available,

   internal defaults.
   To save to the config file initially, check the
   'Save preferences to XML file' in the 'Options'
   dialog.
