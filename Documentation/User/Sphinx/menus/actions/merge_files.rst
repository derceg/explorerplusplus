Merge Files...
--------------

.. image:: /_static/images/mnu_actions/merge_files.png

This function merges **selected** files (which were previously split by
:doc:`Split File... <split_file>`, or other utility) into a single file.
The merge operation is a simple binary concatenation of the files, in
the order shown.

Files to be merged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This area contains the list of files to be merged; the order in which
they appear is the order in which they will be merged. The order may be
changed through the use of the :ref:`buttons
<menus/actions/merge_files:Move Up/Down buttons>` to the right. There is
a good likelihood that - if the files were created by **Explorer++**'s
:doc:`Split File <split_file>` routine, they will already be in the
correct order. Note that the **Date Modified** column respects the
setting of the :ref:`Show user friendly dates
<menus/tools/options/files_and_folders:Show user friendly dates>`
option.

Move Up/Down buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These buttons help manipulate the file list by moving the selected file
(one only!) up or down in the list. If the files were previously split
by :doc:`Split File... <split_file>`, they *should* already be in order.

.. note::

  Multiple files may be selected by default, but **Up/Down** operations
  only operate on a **single** file.

Output File
~~~~~~~~~~~

This edit box contains the path and file name to the final *merged*
output file. The default name is **output** (no extension); the file
will be generated by default in the same folder as the files in the
merge :ref:`list <menus/actions/merge_files:Files to be merged>`.

Output Folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This button opens a standard Windows *Browse for folder* dialog (see
:ref:`here <menus/tools/options/general:Default new tab folder>` for a
picture of this Windows dialog), allowing the user to place the output
file in a different location.

.. tip::

  The *Browse for folder* dialog **only** selects a folder; the user
  must then add a file name. Failure to add a file name will result in
  an error.

  **Example:** *Browse for folder* yields "F:\\myfiles\\temp",

  but user must add "\\final.zip" as filename, making

  **Output File:** "F:\\myfiles\\temp\\final.zip".

Merge (or OK)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking **Merge** (or **OK** - button text may change) performs the
file merge operation, creating a new file. The merge is done using
simple binary concatenation without regard for contents. While any set
of files can be merged, the **Merge Files** action is designed to
*re-combine* files created by the :doc:`Split File <split_file>` action.

.. tip::

  Although individual files may be selected before merging (eg. hold
  **Ctrl** key and select random files), this has no effect. All files
  in the dialog will be merged in the order shown, regardless of any
  selection.

Errors
~~~~~~

.. image:: /_static/images/mnu_actions/merge_error.png

If a **Merge** error occurs, it is likely for one of the following
reasons:

- the named output file already exists. Merge will not offer to
  overwrite the file.
- no file was specified (e.g. C:\\files\\temp\\)
- the output file name matches a folder name, e.g. C:\\files\\temp where
  temp is a sub-folder. This may be a result of choosing an output
  folder but forgetting the file name - see :ref:`Output Folder:
  <menus/actions/merge_files:Output Folder>` above.
