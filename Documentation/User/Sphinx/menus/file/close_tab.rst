Close Tab
---------

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`W`

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`F4`

This menu item closes the current tab in the file pane. Currently, there
is no way to reopen a closed tab (ie. undo the closing operation),
except using normal methods for a :doc:`new tab <new_tab>`.

.. note::

  Starting with version 1.2, closing the last tab can close
  **Explorer++**, as an :ref:`option <menus/tools/options/tabs:Close the
  main window when closing the last tab>`.
