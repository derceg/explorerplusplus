Clone Window
------------

This operation opens a new **Explorer++** window (instance), complete
with all settings and panes copied from the original window. Clone
Window only clones the active tab; other (non-active) tabs are ignored.

Clone Window obeys the setting of the :ref:`Allow multiple instances
<menus/tools/options/window:Allow multiple instances>` option; if
multiple instances are not allowed, then only a new tab is created and
duplicated.

.. note::

  Some settings (eg. column widths in the files pane) may not be
  duplicated.
