Undo
----

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Z`

This function allows you to undo a **single** file or folder
:doc:`renaming <../file/rename>` operation, restoring the original name.
When renaming multiple items using the :ref:`Mass Rename
<menus/file/rename:Multiple items - Mass Rename>` dialog, all items can
be undone as a single operation.

.. caution::

  **Explorer++**'s **Undo** cannot undo a file cut, move or delete.

.. note::

  Renaming a folder which has been :doc:`bookmarked
  <../bookmarks/bookmark_tab>` does **not** automatically rename the
  bookmark.
