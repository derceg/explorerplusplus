Help
----

:kbd:`F1`

This menu item opens the help file at its default page.

You might see the following dialog instead:

.. image:: /_static/images/mnu_help/nohelpfile.png

which means that you haven't yet *installed* the help file. Click on the
link in the dialog to open your browser at the **Explorer++** download
page, and download the file (:bolditalic:`Explorer++ Help.chm`) using
the **Help File** link. It may be in an archived (i.e. zip file) format;
if that is the case, extract it first, then follow the next steps:

- the help file **must** be named **Explorer++ Help.chm** (its default
  name), and
- the help file must be located in the installation directory, i.e. the
  directory housing the executable (**Explorer++.exe**). Move it to that
  location.
- You may need to "*Unblock*" (i.e.. right-click file → Properties →
  Unblock) the help file after extracting. The file may be blocked from
  usage by Windows' security routines. It is a **safe** file.

As of the current version of **Explorer++**, (context sensitive) help
using the **F1** hotkey is not implemented. Only the Help menu item is
functional.
