Drives Toolbar
--------------

For general information about **Explorer++**'s toolbars, ie. moving,
resizing, customizing, etc., see the toolbars :doc:`Overview <index>`.

The **Drives** toolbar displays all available :doc:`volumes
<../menus/go/my_computer>` currently available on your computer.
Clicking a button on the toolbar changes the address of the current tab
in the Files pane to the root of that drive letter (eg. clicking C:
opens C:\\ in the current tab). Hovering over a drive button displays
the free space and total size of the drive as a *tooltip*, if available
(not available if the drive is not ready).

Some users may find it helpful to resize the **Drives** toolbar to its
smallest, and dock it on the same row as the :doc:`Main <main>` toolbar
(right-hand edge). This frees up space, while still providing the
functionality of quickly accessing every drive. When the toolbar is
docked in this way, only the *chevrons* are visible; clicking on the
*chevrons* opens the toolbar as a menu.

.. tip::

  Using the middle-mouse button on a toolbar drive opens that drive in a
  new tab, however, docking the **Drives** toolbar in this way does not
  allow this usage on a menu item (see :ref:`tip <new_tab_tip>` here).

Context Menu (button)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each button on the **Drives** toolbar has a context (ie. right-click)
menu, with the same functions that would be available from Windows
Explorer, or from My Computer (opened in Windows Explorer). In addition,
you may open the drive in a new tab from this menu. The functions
available on the context menu may vary depending on

- the type of drive (ie. Removable, Local, CD, etc.), and
- other applications you may have installed which affect the context
  menu.
