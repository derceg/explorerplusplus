Explorer++ Version History
--------------------------

Version 1.5.0
-------------
New features:
- Dark mode is now available (on Windows 10+) and can be enabled
  via Tools > Options > Appearance > Theme.
- The background context menu has been updated and the menu items
  displayed should be almost identical to those displayed by
  Explorer (this refers to the standard context menu and not the
  simplified menu shown in Windows 11).
- The way in which directories are monitored for changes has been
  updated and should mean that virtual folders are properly
  monitored for changes.
- The main font can now be changed via Tools > Options > Fonts.
  The updated font will be used by most of the controls in the
  main window. The font size can also be changed using the
  shortcuts Ctrl+- and Ctrl++. Ctrl+0 will reset the font size to
  the default.
- A Fluent UI icon set has been added. This icon set can be
  selected from Tools > Options > Appearance > Icon set.
- The way in which command line paths are handled has been
  updated. The change means that relative paths like ".." should
  now be correctly handled and a wider range of paths should be
  accepted. The updated handling also applies to the address bar.
- If Explorer++ is running when the session is ended (e.g. when
  logging off), the settings will now be saved first. Previously,
  the application would simply be terminated.
- DPI changes are now better handled.
- A global history menu is now available at Go > History. That
  menu will display a list of all history items, with more recent
  items appearing first.
- When navigating to a history entry, the file selection will now
  be restored.
- When being used as the default file manager, Explorer++ now
  registers itself as a shell window. That means that in certain
  situations, like when opening an item in Explorer from another
  application, Explorer++ should be opened instead. See #270.
- When items are grouped, the sort mode can now be changed. This
  allows items to be grouped in one way but sorted in another.
  See #381.
- A search tabs dialog has been added. That dialog allows tabs to
  be searched for by both name and path.
- Pasting in virtual folders has been improved.
- Symlinks can now be pasted via Edit > Paste Symbolic Link. That
  operation requires elevation unless developer mode (Windows
  10+) is enabled.
- Large and extra large thumbnail views have been added.
- The options dialog now contains a search field. Entering a term
  in that field will filter the pages shown, with only pages that
  contain the search term remaining.
- The Ctrl and Shift keys can now generally be used to control
  how an item is opened. When Ctrl is down, the item will be
  opened in a new foreground tab; when Ctrl and Shift are down,
  the item will be opened in a new background tab; when Shift is
  down, the item will be opened in a new window.
- An option has been added that allows the user to choose whether
  tabs are opened in the background or foreground by default.
  This option also alters how the Ctrl and Ctrl+Shift modifiers
  work; if tabs are opened in the background by default, Ctrl and
  Ctrl+Shift will work in the opposite way from normal.
- The back, forward and up toolbar buttons can now be middle
  clicked.
- The up toolbar button now has a dropdown menu that displays a
  list of parent items.
- When a bookmark folder is clicked on the bookmarks toolbar, a
  dropdown menu will be shown. It's now possible to drag items
  from that menu to another location. It's also possible to
  rearrange the bookmarks on the menu via drag and drop.
- It's now possible to rename drives (which changes their label).
- When renaming an item, the display name is switched with the
  editing name. That ensures that the text being changed is
  correct when the item is a drive.
- It's now possible to delete a folder that's open in Explorer++.
  In that situation, the associated tab will navigate to the
  parent folder.
- A --select command line option has been added that will open a
  directory and select the file specified. See #208.
- Paths separated by forward slashes are now accepted. See #382.
- The home folder can now optionally be shown in the treeview.
- An option to display mixed files and folders has been added and
  can be set via Tools > Options > File and Folders > Display
  mixed files and folders. See #30.
- An option to choose whether to use a natural sort order (i.e. a
  sort order in which file2.txt comes before file19.txt) has been
  added and can be set via Tools > Options > File and Folders >
  Use natural sort order. See #46.
- An option to disable navigating up when double clicking in an
  empty area in the listview has been added. The option can be
  set via Tools > Options > Advanced > Go up on double click
  in listview.
- When right-clicking a bookmark in the main menu, a context menu
  is now shown.
- Added Arabic (United Arab Emirates), Greek and Portuguese
  (Brazil) translations.
- The layout will now be switched to RTL when using the Arabic or
  Hebrew translations.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a crash that could occur on startup when the "Open new
  tabs next to the current one" option was enabled.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when autosizing columns.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when retrieving the icon for a
  treeview item. See #385.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when attempting to create a
  folder in a location where the total path length for the new
  item would be greater than 260 characters.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when retrieving the status of a
  network adapter. See #455.
- Fixed a crash that could occur after switching from thumbnails
  view. See #460.
- Fixed a crash that could occur during application shutdown. See
  #388.
- Non US-ASCII characters weren't being properly handled on the
  command line. See #266.
- Quoted paths are now consistently handled correctly when passed
  on the command line. This is important, for example, when
  multiple paths are being passed in and more than one path
  contains spaces (and therefore more than one path will need to
  be enclosed in double quotes).
- Previously, if an item was cut or copied within a tab and the
  tab was closed, the clipboard data would be lost when the
  application exited. Now, the clipboard is flushed when the tab
  is closed, which ensures the data will be retained, even once
  the application has exited.
- Fixed an issue with handling the properties item on the
  background context menu.
- Previously, listview groups were always sorted by name. Now,
  they're sorted based on the attributes of the groups
  themselves. See #101.
- The group an item is in is now updated when the item is
  updated. See #110.
- When pressing backspace in a locked tab to navigate up, the
  navigation would occur in that tab, instead of a new tab. See
  #265.
- If a filtered item is renamed, it will now be shown again if it
  no longer needs to be filtered. Previously, the item would
  remain hidden until filtering was disabled.
- When starting the application, the previous window position
  will only be used if it's visible. If the saved position is
  off-screen (e.g. because the monitor configuration has
  changed), the default position will be used instead.
- A saved dialog position will now only be used if the saved
  position is visible on screen.
- When renaming an item, the item is updated immediately if the
  rename succeeds. Previously, the item details would be updated
  a short time later. That meant that renaming an item, then
  immediately pressing enter would fail to open the item. See
  #281.
- Renaming virtual items in the treeview now works as expected.
- Pressing F2 wouldn't cycle between the filename and extension.
  See #293.
- Previously, when running the application under Windows PE, the
  treeview was empty.
- When selecting "Lock Tab", the tab acted as if "Lock Tab and
  Address" had been selected.
- Pasting an image from the clipboard wouldn't always generate a
  correct image file. See #307.
- The treeview now has both a minimum width and maximum width.
  This also means that in situations where the treeview width was
  previously reduced below 0, it will be shown again.
- When renaming an item in the listview or treeview,
  Ctrl+Backspace now erases the last word, rather than inserting
  a non-printable character. See #299.

Misc:
- ARM64 builds are now available.
- When changing the default file manager setting (via Tools >
  Options > General > Default File Manager), Explorer++ will only
  be set/removed as the default file manager for the current
  user. Previously, Explorer++ was set as the default for all
  users.
  If you set Explorer++ as the default in a previous version,
  remove it as the default before you update, then change it back
  to the default after you've updated.
- The HTML Help (chm) documentation has been removed. The help
  menu item now simply links to the online documentation, from
  which a PDF can be generated, if needed.
- Improved crash handling. The updated handling means that the
  application should show an informational dialog more reliably
  when a crash occurs.
- Clicking on a bookmark now has the same effect as entering the
  bookmark path in the address bar and pressing enter. That means
  that the handling improvements mentioned above for the command
  line/address bar also apply to bookmarks. This also means that
  a bookmark to a file will now open that file and a bookmark can
  now contain a relative path.
- If a navigation fails, the current folder won't change.
  Previously, Explorer++ would seemingly open the folder, though
  display no items.
- The clipboard data generated when copying items is now
  retrieved from the shell, rather than being manually generated.
  That should mean copying works better, particularly in virtual
  folders. See #80 and #99.
- The data generated when dragging an item is now retrieved from
  the shell, which means drag and drop operations should work
  better. See #144.
- Dropping on a non-folder target (e.g. an executable or zip
  file) should now work. See #75 and #297.
- The items shown on the "Go" menu have been updated.
- The ability to play a navigation sound has been removed.
- The option to use fixed width tabs has been removed, as it
  doesn't appear to be properly supported by the tab control. See
  #255.

Version 1.4.0 (29/01/2024)
--------------------------
New features:
- The bookmarks system has been rewritten. The updated system has
  the following changes from the previous system:
  - Bookmarks are now managed in a very similar way to how
    they're managed in web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.
    Bookmarks can be added to one of three top-level folders:
    - Bookmarks toolbar
    - Bookmarks menu
    - Other bookmarks
  - The add bookmark and manage bookmark dialogs are more
    functional than their equivalents in the previous version.
    For example, the manage bookmarks dialog allows items to be
    renamed directly (rather than by opening the edit bookmark
    dialog) and shows an appropriate context menu for bookmark
    folders in the treeview.
  - Bookmarks can now be copied/pasted.
  - When a bookmark is copied, the location of the bookmark is
    also copied as plain text. This makes it possible to paste
    the location into other applications.
  - Bookmarks can now be dragged and dropped between the bookmark
    windows.
  - Bookmarks on the bookmarks toolbar can now be arranged via
    drag and drop.
  - Right-clicking an item in the dropdown shown when clicking a
    folder on the bookmarks toolbar now shows the appropriate
    context menu.
  - In addition to being able to bookmark the current tab, it's
    also possible to bookmark all open tabs.
  - When a bookmark is displayed, the icon for the associated
    folder will be used (rather than a generic icon).
  - When right-clicking a bookmark folder, it's possible to open
    all child bookmarks in new tabs.
  - A number of issues present in the previous system are no
    longer relevant. For example:
    - The bookmark menu wasn't being built correctly (folders
      could be shown with the wrong name).
    - Selecting "Bookmark This Tab..." from the dropdown shown
      when clicking a folder on the bookmarks toolbar had no
      effect.
    - "Open" and "Open in New Tab" items would be shown when
      right-clicking a folder on the bookmarks toolbar, but
      selecting them would have no effect.
    - Neither the bookmarks toolbar nor the bookmarks menu would
      update when a bookmark was moved up/down.
    - The bookmarks menu wasn't updated when a bookmark was
      updated.
  - The bookmark description field has been removed.
- Settings are now automatically saved every 30 seconds. This
  helps to prevent recent tabs or other settings from being lost
  if the application crashes.
- The default icons used by the application have been updated.
  Additionally, a second set of Windows 10 style icons have been
  added. It's possible to switch between the two icon sets via
  Tools > Options > General > Icon theme.
- Added partial support for high DPI displays.
- It's now possible to reopen a recently closed tab using File >
  Reopen Recent Tab. The most recently closed tab can be reopened
  using Ctrl+Shift+T.
- The display window can now be displayed on the right.
  Previously, it was always displayed at the bottom.
- Support for the "Date Deleted" and "Original Location" recycle
  bin columns has been implemented.
- A context menu is now shown when right-clicking the empty space
  in the tab bar.
- When renaming a file, it's possible to move to the next item by
  pressing tab. Shift+tab can now be used to move to the previous
  item.
- Toolbar buttons are now available for the following actions:
  - Split file
  - Merge files
  - Close tab

Bug fixes:
- The way in which column results and file icons/thumbnails are
  retrieved has been updated. This update brings a number of
  advantages:
  - Because of the way in which column result/icons/thumbnails
    were retrieved previously, it was possible for the
    application to crash if a navigation occurred while one of
    these items was being retrieved. Navigating to a different
    directory or closing a tab while results are being retrieved
    should now have no negative effects.
  - Column details are only retrieved for items that are visible
    (rather than all items).
  - Previously, it was possible for a user interface update to be
    done after a navigation had occurred. That is, column data
    for an item in a previous folder would be inserted into the
    listview for the current folder. This is no longer possible.
  - Previously, if an item was moved (within the listview) or
    deleted, it was possible for the wrong item to be updated
    once a column result/icon/thumbnail had been retrieved. This
    is no longer possible.
- When right-clicking on the listview background in Windows 10,
  Explorer++ would crash. To resolve this, the OneDrive shell
  extension is now ignored when showing the menu. See #35.
- Items in virtual folders (e.g. library folders) can now be
  renamed and deleted.
- Items can now be copied to/moved to virtual folders (using the
  "Copy To Folder"/"Move To Folder" functionality).
- New folders can now be created in virtual folders.
- Fixed issue with date conversion. Previously, dates would be
  converted in the current time zone, rather than the time zone
  in effect at the time being converted.
- Fixed an issue that caused taskbar thumbnails (shown on Windows
  7 and above) to not always be displayed correctly. See #55.
- When renaming a file, it's possible to press tab to put the
  next file into edit mode. On Windows 10, pressing tab would
  select the next file, but it would not go into edit mode.
  Fixed. See #50.
- Previously, when creating a file via the new menu in Windows
  10, the file would not be put into edit mode. Fixed. See #48.
- The Explorer++ icon shown in the volume mixer was larger than
  it should have been. Fixed. See #24.
- Under certain conditions, switching to a tab using the taskbar
  thumbnails would result in the wrong tab being selected. Fixed.
- Under certain conditions, refreshing a tab via the tab
  right-click menu would result in the wrong tab being refreshed.
  Fixed.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when switching directories.
- When grouping items by date created/modified/accessed, the
  items weren't being properly sorted into their groups (as
  month/year boundaries weren't being handled). Fixed.
- Previously, when a date was formatted as a friendly date,
  year/month boundaries weren't being taken into account. This
  meant that a date would only be shown as "Yesterday" if it was
  in the same month/year as the current date. Fixed.
- When adding or removing a column via the listview header
  context menu, the sort by/group by menus wouldn't be updated.
  Fixed.
- When opening the set file attributes dialog, the creation date
  shown was incorrect. Fixed.
- The set file attributes dialog wasn't correctly handling the
  case where an attribute checkbox was indeterminate. Fixed.
- There was an issue that meant that the group sorting direction
  in one tab could affect the group sorting order in other tabs.
  Fixed.
- When adding the folders button to the main toolbar (either by
  resetting the toolbar or by adding that individual button),
  the state of the button wouldn't be set correctly. Even if the
  folders pane was shown, the button wouldn't be checked. Fixed.
- When using the "list" view mode, right-clicking the empty space
  in a row would inconsistently result in the item being
  selected. Now, an item is only selected if you right-click its
  filename label.
- Some columns were effectively skipped over when saving data to
  the XML config file. Additionally, if one of these columns
  appeared first, the application would crash when exiting.
  Fixed.
- When loading from the XML config file, the initial color in the
  color rule dialog wasn't been loaded correctly. Fixed.
- There was an issue that prevented labels in the treeview from
  being unfolded. Now, if you move the mouse over a treeview
  label that's only partially visible, the rest of the label will
  be shown in a tooltip.
- Fixed a number of memory leaks.

Misc:
- Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported. Windows 7 is now
  the minimum supported version.
- All menus are now drawn in the standard system style, rather
  than a custom style.
- More detailed help information is now available when starting
  Explorer++ from the command line with the --help flag. Each of
  the available options is listed and briefly described. The
  names of some of the options have also been updated.
- Starting a command prompt via the file menu opens a command
  prompt in the current directory. Starting an admin command
  prompt now does the same thing (rather than opening in the
  default directory).
- The format used to display dates has been updated. Previously,
  the date and time were separated by a comma. Now, they're
  separated by a space.
- Infotips for files/folders are now retrieved on a background
  thread. This stops the application from hanging when
  retrieving the infotip for a large folder.
- Listview icons are now cached. This helps to avoid the
  flickering that can occur when refreshing a directory or going
  back/forward (the apparent flickering occurs as the default
  file/folder icons are replaced with the actual file/folder
  icons).
- Due to the way in which listview items were deleted when
  navigating away from a folder, navigations away from large
  folders could be slow. This process should now be quicker.
- The way in which the document summary fields (e.g. title,
  subject) are retrieved has been updated. This means that the
  fields should now be displayed for more file types (e.g. Word
  documents).
- When selecting a file path with spaces in the application
  toolbar button dialog, the path is now quoted (which is
  necessary for paths with spaces).
- An error message is now shown when opening an item on the
  application toolbar fails.
- The columns in the select columns dialog are now sorted by
  name, with the current set of columns appearing at the top of
  the list.
- When grouping by file extension, the application would attempt
  to retrieve the extension for both files and folders. Now, the
  extension will only be retrieved for files. Folders will be
  grouped together in a "Folder" group.
- The order in which view modes are cycled (when clicking the
  "Views" button on the toolbar or scrolling the mouse wheel
  while holding ctrl) has been reversed to match the order used
  in Windows Explorer.
- A third-party credits dialog has been added, which can be
  opened via the about dialog.

Version 1.3.5 (03/02/2013)
--------------------------
New features:
- Added support for another drag and drop format (which is used,
  for example, by Outlook 2003 when copying attachments).

Bug fixes:
- The 'Open in New Tab' menu item was not always been added to
  the folder context menu. Fixed.
- Previously, file times could not be set for a directory using
  the set file attributes dialog. Fixed.
- A UTF-16 LE BOM is now written when pasting text (as a file).

Misc:
- Logging is now available. It can be enabled using the following
  command:
  explorer++.exe -enable_logging
  Information will then be saved to Explorer++.log, which will be
  created within the same directory as the executable.

Version 1.3.4 (12/11/2011)
--------------------------
New features:
- Implemented the media protection column.

Bug fixes:
- If the search dialog was closed while searching, the
  application would crash. Fixed.
- When clicking the 'Close' button while searching (in the search
  dialog), the dialog would not close until the search was
  finished. It could also result in a crash. Fixed.
- Fixed multithreaded bug in the search dialog.
- In certain areas (such as the search dialog), Unicode
  characters were not been converted to lowercase correctly.
  Fixed.

Version 1.3.3 (29/10/2011)
--------------------------
Bug fixes:
- The media duration column was previously showing times in
  100-nanosecond units. Updated to hh:mm:ss.
- The processed search string (rather than original search
  string) was been stored in the search dialog. Fixed.

Misc:
- When searching using the search dialog, if the filename entered
  already appears in the history list, it will simply be swapped
  to the first position (rather than been re-entered).
- The number of history entries stored for the filename field in
  the search dialog is now capped at 20.

Version 1.3.2 (11/10/2011)
--------------------------
Bug fixes:
- Under some circumstances, a copy and paste/drag and drop
  operation would fail (when copying a message from Outlook 2010,
  for example).
- Fixed bug in customize colors dialog (entries were not been
  moved up/down correctly).
- When renaming a file in the listview with IME turned on, text
  was been overwritten (because the text selection was modified).
  Fixed.
- Links to zip files will now be opened in an external program,
  if 'Open zip files in Explorer++' is unchecked.

Version 1.3.1 (05/09/2011)
--------------------------
New features:
- The sort mode and direction are now saved in the search dialog.

Bug fixes:
- The image in the about dialog would not be shown when a
  translation was loaded. Fixed.

Misc:
- The help file (if present) can now be launched from the
  Help|Help menu. It must be named "Explorer++ Help.chm" and be
  in the same folder as the Explorer++ executable.
- Updated 'Always hide the link (.lnk) extension' option to read
  'Hide the link (.lnk) extension'.

Version 1.3 (20/08/2011)
------------------------
New features:
- The complete state of most dialogs are now saved.
- Most dialogs can now be resized.
- Significant improvements to split file dialog.
- Context menu extensions are now shown on the main right-click
  context menu.
- Enhanced undo functionality. Multiple rename operations (such
  as those performed by the mass rename dialog) can now be undone
  as a single set.
- 'Delete permanently' button added to main toolbar.
- Added 'Close Tabs to the Right' entry to the tab right-click
  menu.
- The listview hover time can now be set by the user.
- Right-clicking search dialog results now brings up the file
  context menu.
- Search dialog results can now be sorted by name/path.
- Added 'Case sensitive' option to filter dialog.
- The folder navigation sound can now be disabled via the options
  dialog.
- The search dialog can now search using regular expressions. A
  case insensitive flag has also been added.
- Deleting an item in the treeview will select the parent folder
  prior to deletion (allowing the previously selected folder to
  be deleted).
- Right-clicking on the root desktop folder in the treeview now
  brings up its context menu.
- Trailing spaces are now trimmed when renaming an item in the
  listview/treeview.

Bug fixes:
- In Windows 7 when closing a tab, the wrong taskbar preview pane
  would be closed (i.e. the taskbar preview pane for another tab
  would be closed instead).
- Fixed a crash that occurred when collapsing a node in the
  treeview.
- When single-click activation was enabled, and an area in the
  listview was selected, any file under the mouse when it was
  released would be opened. Fixed.
- Fixed 'Open Parent in New Tab' bug (parent of current tab would
  always be opened, regardless of which tab was clicked).
- When opening a folder in a locked tab, the newly created tab
  was not switched to correctly (which caused directory
  modifications to fail, for example). Fixed.
- Fixed toolbar bug (when a button was added or removed from a
  toolbar, the length of the toolbar would be reset, causing it
  to resize).
- Fixed listview gridline issue (Windows XP only).
- Under certain circumstances, translation DLL's would still be
  loaded, even if they did not match the current version. Fixed.
- Filename extension is now hidden correctly (if required) in
  details view.
- Size column now remains right aligned after sorting.
- When allow multiple instances was not set, and a new instance
  was started, it would not restore the previous window correctly
  if it was minimized. Fixed.
- Summary information stream codepage wasn't been checked. Fixed.
- Fixed control panel handling bug.
- Fixed drag and drop memory leak.
- Fixed bugs in mouse wheel handler.
- Fixed bug in options dialog (apply button not enabled when
  changing size selection in files and folders tab).

Misc:
- Version number now takes the form: Major.Minor.Micro.Revision.
- Improved drag and drop interoperability.
- File sizes are now formatted according to the current system
  locale.
- When collapsing the direct parent of the current folder in the
  treeview, the listview selection would change to the parent.
  Now works when collapsing multiple levels.
- The 'Size On Disk', 'Total Size', and 'Free Space' columns are
  now right aligned.
- The current directory is now set when the directory or tab
  selection changes.
- Updated 'Handle zip files' option to read 'Open zip files in
  Explorer++'.
- The error message shown on a translation DLL version mismatch
  will now be shown in the target language (when possible).
- The (main) right click context menu is no longer owner drawn.

Version 1.2 (13/09/2010)
------------------------
New features:
- Taskbar thumbnails are now shown for each tab in Windows 7
  (this can be turned on/off by toggling 'Show taskbar
  thumbnails' in the Options dialog).
- 'New Tab' added to Tasks jump list in Windows 7.
- Numerous improvements to drag and drop/copy and paste.
- Text on the clipboard can now be pasted as a file. The file
  will be given a name of the form:
  Clipboard Text ([datetime]).txt.
  This also applies to drag and drop.
- Images on the clipboard can now be pasted as a file. The file
  will be given a name of the form:
  Clipboard Image ([datetime]).bmp.
  This also applies to drag and drop.
- The contents of the address bar can now be dragged and dropped.
- Large toolbar icons added.
- Files can now be dropped onto existing application toolbar
  buttons. This will open the dropped files in that application.
- 'Automatically synchronize treeview with main pane' option
  added; this setting controls whether or not the treeview will
  automatically stay in sync with the listview whilst browsing.
- 'Automatically expand nodes on selection' option added; if this
  setting is enabled treeview nodes will automatically expand
  when they are selected.
- Shift+Mousewheel down and shift+mousewheel up can now be used
  to browse backwards and forwards, respectively.
- The tab bar can now be hidden when there is only one tab.
- The tab bar can now be shown at the bottom of the listview.
- A navigation sound is now played when entering a folder.
- The current folder is now selected when navigating up.
- Listview groups can now be collapsed (Vista and later).
- Listview checkboxes can now be turned on by selecting 'Use
  check boxes to select items' in the Options dialog.
- Closing the last tab will now close the main window (provided
  the corresponding option is selected in the Options dialog).

   cut anyway using Ctrl+X, the item would be ghosted whether or
   not it was actually placed on the clipboard. Fixed.

 - Fixed tab highlight bug.
 - Because of a timing problem, it was possible that when
   Explorer++ was opened, the first icon(s) shown may not have
