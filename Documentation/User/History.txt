Explorer++ Version History
--------------------------

Version 1.4.1
-------------
Misc:
- When changing the default file manager setting (via Tools >
  Options > General > Default File Manager), Explorer++ will only
  be set/removed as the default file manager for the current
  user. Previously, Explorer++ was set as the default for all
  users.
  If you set Explorer++ as the default in a previous version,
  remove it as the default before you update, then change it back
  to the default after you've updated.

Version 1.4.0
-------------
New features:
- The bookmarks system has been rewritten. The updated system has
  the following changes from the previous system:
  - Bookmarks are now managed in a very similar way to how
    they're managed in web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.
    Bookmarks can be added to one of three top-level folders:
    - Bookmarks toolbar
    - Bookmarks menu
    - Other bookmarks
  - The add bookmark and manage bookmark dialogs are more
    functional than their equivalents in the previous version.
    For example, the manage bookmarks dialog allows items to be
    renamed directly (rather than by opening the edit bookmark
    dialog) and shows an appropriate context menu for bookmark
    folders in the treeview.
  - Bookmarks can now be copied/pasted.
  - When a bookmark is copied, the location of the bookmark is
    also copied as plain text. This makes it possible to paste
    the location into other applications.
  - Bookmarks can now be dragged and dropped between the bookmark
    windows.
  - Bookmarks on the bookmarks toolbar can now be arranged via
    drag and drop.
  - Right-clicking an item in the dropdown shown when clicking a
    folder on the bookmarks toolbar now shows the appropriate
    context menu.
  - In addition to being able to bookmark the current tab, it's
    also possible to bookmark all open tabs.
  - When a bookmark is displayed, the icon for the associated
    folder will be used (rather than a generic icon).
  - When right-clicking a bookmark folder, it's possible to open
    all child bookmarks in new tabs.
  - A number of issues present in the previous system are no
    longer relevant. For example:
    - The bookmark menu wasn't being built correctly (folders
      could be shown with the wrong name).
    - Selecting "Bookmark This Tab..." from the dropdown shown
      when clicking a folder on the bookmarks toolbar had no
      effect.
    - "Open" and "Open in New Tab" items would be shown when
      right-clicking a folder on the bookmarks toolbar, but
      selecting them would have no effect.
    - Neither the bookmarks toolbar nor the bookmarks menu would
      update when a bookmark was moved up/down.
    - The bookmarks menu wasn't updated when a bookmark was
      updated.
  - The bookmark description field has been removed.
- Settings are now automatically saved every 30 seconds. This
  helps to prevent recent tabs or other settings from being lost
  if the application crashes.
- The default icons used by the application have been updated.
  Additionally, a second set of Windows 10 style icons have been
  added. It's possible to switch between the two icon sets via
  Tools > Options > General > Icon theme.
- Added partial support for high DPI displays.
- It's now possible to reopen a recently closed tab using File >
  Reopen Recent Tab. The most recently closed tab can be reopened
  using Ctrl+Shift+T.
- The display window can now be displayed on the right.
  Previously, it was always displayed at the bottom.
- Support for the "Date Deleted" and "Original Location" recycle
  bin columns has been implemented.
- A context menu is now shown when right-clicking the empty space
  in the tab bar.
- When renaming a file, it's possible to move to the next item by
  pressing tab. Shift+tab can now be used to move to the previous
  item.
- Toolbar buttons are now available for the following actions:
  - Split file
  - Merge files
  - Close tab

Bug fixes:
- The way in which column results and file icons/thumbnails are
  retrieved has been updated. This update brings a number of
  advantages:
  - Because of the way in which column result/icons/thumbnails
    were retrieved previously, it was possible for the
    application to crash if a navigation occurred while one of
    these items was being retrieved. Navigating to a different
    directory or closing a tab while results are being retrieved
    should now have no negative effects.
  - Column details are only retrieved for items that are visible
    (rather than all items).
  - Previously, it was possible for a user interface update to be
    done after a navigation had occurred. That is, column data
    for an item in a previous folder would be inserted into the
    listview for the current folder. This is no longer possible.
  - Previously, if an item was moved (within the listview) or
    deleted, it was possible for the wrong item to be updated
    once a column result/icon/thumbnail had been retrieved. This
    is no longer possible.
- When right-clicking on the listview background in Windows 10,
  Explorer++ would crash. To resolve this, the OneDrive shell
  extension is now ignored when showing the menu. See #35.
- Items in virtual folders (e.g. library folders) can now be
  renamed and deleted.
- Items can now be copied to/moved to virtual folders (using the
  "Copy To Folder"/"Move To Folder" functionality).
- New folders can now be created in virtual folders.
- Fixed issue with date conversion. Previously, dates would be
  converted in the current time zone, rather than the time zone
  in effect at the time being converted.
- Fixed an issue that caused taskbar thumbnails (shown on Windows
  7 and above) to not always be displayed correctly. See #55.
- When renaming a file, it's possible to press tab to put the
  next file into edit mode. On Windows 10, pressing tab would
  select the next file, but it would not go into edit mode.
  Fixed. See #50.
- Previously, when creating a file via the new menu in Windows
  10, the file would not be put into edit mode. Fixed. See #48.
- The Explorer++ icon shown in the volume mixer was larger than
  it should have been. Fixed. See #24.
- Under certain conditions, switching to a tab using the taskbar
  thumbnails would result in the wrong tab being selected. Fixed.
- Under certain conditions, refreshing a tab via the tab
  right-click menu would result in the wrong tab being refreshed.
  Fixed.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when switching directories.
- When grouping items by date created/modified/accessed, the
  items weren't being properly sorted into their groups (as
  month/year boundaries weren't being handled). Fixed.
- Previously, when a date was formatted as a friendly date,
  year/month boundaries weren't being taken into account. This
  meant that a date would only be shown as "Yesterday" if it was
  in the same month/year as the current date. Fixed.
- When adding or removing a column via the listview header
  context menu, the sort by/group by menus wouldn't be updated.
  Fixed.
- When opening the set file attributes dialog, the creation date
  shown was incorrect. Fixed.
- The set file attributes dialog wasn't correctly handling the
  case where an attribute checkbox was indeterminate. Fixed.
- There was an issue that meant that the group sorting direction
  in one tab could affect the group sorting order in other tabs.
  Fixed.
- When adding the folders button to the main toolbar (either by
  resetting the toolbar or by adding that individual button),
  the state of the button wouldn't be set correctly. Even if the
  folders pane was shown, the button wouldn't be checked. Fixed.
- When using the "list" view mode, right-clicking the empty space
  in a row would inconsistently result in the item being
  selected. Now, an item is only selected if you right-click its
  filename label.
- When loading from the XML config file, the initial color in the
  color rule dialog wasn't been loaded correctly. Fixed.
- There was an issue that prevented labels in the treeview from
  being unfolded. Now, if you move the mouse over a treeview
  label that's only partially visible, the rest of the label will
  be shown in a tooltip.
- Fixed a number of memory leaks.

Misc:
- Windows XP and Vista are no longer supported. Windows 7 is now
  the minimum supported version.
- All menus are now drawn in the standard system style, rather
  than a custom style.
- More detailed help information is now available when starting
  Explorer++ from the command line with the --help flag. Each of
  the available options is listed and briefly described. The
  names of some of the options have also been updated.
- Starting a command prompt via the file menu opens a command
  prompt in the current directory. Starting an admin command
  prompt now does the same thing (rather than opening in the
  default directory).
- The format used to display dates has been updated. Previously,
  the date and time were separated by a comma. Now, they're
  separated by a space.
- Dates are now displayed without seconds.
- Infotips for files/folders are now retrieved on a background
  thread. This stops the application from hanging when
  retrieving the infotip for a large folder.
- Listview icons are now cached. This helps to avoid the
  flickering that can occur when refreshing a directory or going
  back/forward (the apparent flickering occurs as the default
  file/folder icons are replaced with the actual file/folder
  icons).
- The way in which the document summary fields (e.g. title,
  subject) are retrieved has been updated. This means that the
  fields should now be displayed for more file types (e.g. Word
  documents).
- When selecting a file path with spaces in the application
  toolbar button dialog, the path is now quoted (which is
  necessary for paths with spaces).
- The columns in the select columns dialog are now sorted by
  name, with the current set of columns appearing at the top of
  the list.
- When grouping by file extension, the application would attempt
  to retrieve the extension for both files and folders. Now, the
  extension will only be retrieved for files. Folders will be
  grouped together in a "Folder" group.
- The order in which view modes are cycled (when clicking the
  "Views" button on the toolbar or scrolling the mouse wheel
  while holding ctrl) has been reversed to match the order used
  in Windows Explorer.
- A third-party credits dialog has been added, which can be
  opened via the about dialog.

Version 1.3.5 (03/02/2013)
--------------------------
New features:
- Added support for another drag and drop format (which is used,
  for example, by Outlook 2003 when copying attachments).

Bug fixes:
- The 'Open in New Tab' menu item was not always been added to
  the folder context menu. Fixed.
- Previously, file times could not be set for a directory using
  the set file attributes dialog. Fixed.

Misc:
- Logging is now available. It can be enabled using the following
  command:
  explorer++.exe -enable_logging
  Information will then be saved to Explorer++.log, which will be
  created within the same directory as the executable.

Version 1.3.4 (12/11/2011)
--------------------------
New features:
- Implemented the media protection column.

Bug fixes:
- If the search dialog was closed while searching, the
  application would crash. Fixed.
- When clicking the 'Close' button while searching (in the search
  dialog), the dialog would not close until the search was
  finished. It could also result in a crash. Fixed.
- Fixed multithreaded bug in the search dialog.
- In certain areas (such as the search dialog), Unicode
  characters were not been converted to lowercase correctly.
  Fixed.

Version 1.3.3 (29/10/2011)
--------------------------
Bug fixes:
- The media duration column was previously showing times in
  100-nanosecond units. Updated to hh:mm:ss.
- The processed search string (rather than original search
  string) was been stored in the search dialog. Fixed.

Misc:
- When searching using the search dialog, if the filename entered
  already appears in the history list, it will simply be swapped
  to the first position (rather than been re-entered).
- The number of history entries stored for the filename field in
  the search dialog is now capped at 20.

Version 1.3.2 (11/10/2011)
--------------------------
Bug fixes:
- Under some circumstances, a copy and paste/drag and drop
  operation would fail (when copying a message from Outlook 2010,
  for example).
- Fixed bug in customize colors dialog (entries were not been
  moved up/down correctly).
- When renaming a file in the listview with IME turned on, text
  was been overwritten (because the text selection was modified).
  Fixed.

  if 'Open zip files in Explorer++' is unchecked.

- When opening a folder in a locked tab, the newly created tab
  was not switched to correctly (which caused directory

   extension would be dropped.
 - When renaming a file within the listview, if the proposed
   filename ended with a trailing space or period, the rename

   a period, everything before the period would be selected (as
   for files).

   and keys, such as the back and forward buttons found on some

   combined size would not be shown correctly. Fixed.

   unit (bytes, KB, MB, etc), the fourth character would not be
   shown, causing the size to appear to be incorrect. Fixed.
 - Fixed a paste file bug.
 - If a file that could not be cut (such as a virtual item) was
   cut anyway using Ctrl+X, the item would be ghosted whether or
   not it was actually placed on the clipboard. Fixed.
 - The address bar would not scroll horizontally. Fixed.
 - Fixed tab highlight bug.
 - Because of a timing problem, it was possible that when
   Explorer++ was opened, the first icon(s) shown may not have
   been correct. Fixed.

 - On a rename operation, if a files new name contains an invalid

   'Computer' on Vista.
 - Added an error message for the situation when a new folder
   could not be created.

----------------------------
New features:
 - Explorer++ is now built as a Unicode executable.

    2. the registry

 - A command line usage message can now be shown by typing:
